    Senior wali feeling na dene ke liye,
    Har choti si chiz ko kese tackle
    karna hai, sikhane ke liye
    Faltu ke doubt sunne ke liye
    Rote hue ko chup karane ke liye
    Nasamajh ko zimmedar banane ke liye
    Bahut bahut Dhanyawad.....

    Well, I have heard Varsha ma'am and Sanskriti singing together, that was quite entertaining.
    Subham bhaiya was quite famous for meme lord. He told us various embarassing stories of him in college. Plus, he is a hell of a coder. Ujjwal bhaiya was the one who guided us for the activities, whether being a club visit or any other college
    fests, academics etc..
    We went ghats together, agriculture farm and varuous more places along. Will miss those days‚ù§Ô∏è

    It's awesome to have seniors like you. I feel privileged to have met you. Being a member of HHC, I have been lucky enough to interact
    quite frequently with you guys. We  all learnt a lot from you and you all inspired me in so many ways.
    We feel like family together. We shared moments together.I still remember my first meeeting with Ojha and Khare bhaiaya and that
    morning boating at Assi ghat.We could've shared some more memories if Corona hadnk't disrupted us.

    Shubham bhaiya, I'll always remember the time I had spent with you in HHC. Your sense of humour is so great that anyone can't be bored
    with you. You don't feel hesitation to make us laugh by your good but mischievious memories. That's actually a very good characterstic
    of your personality. You will be remembered not only as HHC member but also as a helpful senior. You were always helpful to me and guided
    me in many ways related to future career possibilities. It is not possible to celebrate your farewell but I wish you good luck for your
    beautiful future with bright opportunities waiting for you ahead...

    Subham bhaiya is a funny Guy and makes the meetings joyfull and interesting.
    Ujjwal bhaiya, you are one of the very intelligent seniors whom I met in institute.
    Learned a lot from you in meetings. Listening to what to do for society.

  <div class="Abhishek-2">
    I was very shy. So, I just go in meetings and sit there and listen to all other members. But
    Varsha ma‚Äôam gave me the chance to give my opinions and ask to tell something.
    I also visited schools with her in which she guides us and give chance to new members like me  to get involved in the club activities

      I have no hesitation in claiming that Shubham bhaiya is among the most humble and chilled out seniors that
       I have come across in our college. And the Bilaspur connection just makes it sweeter. From nearly managing to miss our train
        ( I‚Äôll forever be grateful for your help with my luggage) to the many sessions of ‚Äúgyaan‚Äù at your room, it was ride.
        You were a fabulous HHC secy, even if you don‚Äôt consider yourself the same. Jahan jao Bakchodi failao!!!!
